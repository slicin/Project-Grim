*knock knock*
...
Oh, hello dear. Come already?
It always seems so far away, until it’s here.
I don’t think so... but I accept it.
Well, come inside.
I have been waiting for you.
Never knew when you’d come of course,
but I knew you would.
Oh, I just got some cookies out of the oven.
They will want to cool down a bit.
Why don’t you make yourself at home?
Look around a little if you want.
I’ll be in the garden when you’re ready.
