Oh, there you are.
Now, how did you like it inside?
Do you think I have a nice house?
Oh, thank you dear.
It means a lot coming from you.
Well I suppose you’d know.
You must’ve seen it all, hm?
To tell you the truth,
I wouldn’t have minded a few more years.
Some time to finish my books,
water the plants, learn to paint,
watch my grandchildren grow old.
But I suppose it can’t be.
No one else gets to do that.
See their grandchildren grow old I mean.
It wouldn’t be so nice I imagine.
Aging can be rough on a young lady.
But don’t you worry about that now.
You’re just doing your job, as I’ve done mine.
Why don’t you take a cookie?
You could use some meat on those bones, hm?
Oh, I made them with chocolate and honey.
That way they get that special sweetness.
No need to be humble.
I doubt anyone else will come by to eat them.
When I was still teaching, there’d be children
all over this back yard of mine.
Didn’t have all the delicate plants then,
so they were free to play where they wanted.
Oh, the students loved to join me for cookies 
every Friday after class. Or was it Tuesday?
Oh, my dear Gregory always said I spoiled them,
but I think they learned a lot more from me.
If anything, perhaps I was a little rough
on my own children.
I tried to make a point
to treat them like any of my students in class.
They're both grown up now, and parents themselves.
They still call me, so
I must have done something right.
My husband was... was very worried about Jacob,
but he turned out to be a very nice gentleman.
And he certainly built a nice family now.
Oh... Gregory really would be proud.
I... I'm a little scared to ask this, but...
Was Gregory alright when he met you?
Ha ha, that sounds like him.
Bravely staring you down,
even as you take him away...
He was always very proud.
I was sure he wouldn’t have conceded to you easily.
Me? Oh you must think I’m stalling.
I won’t make you wait much longer,
I promise.
What will it be like once I’m gone?
Are my children going to be alright?
Oh, I do hope they won’t be too sad.
If there was some way to let them know...
Oh well, no sense worrying anymore.
They’ll be alright. I just know it.
But what about me now, hm?
Is there another life beyond this?
I believe you, you know.
I used to be scared of you.
It feels strange to think that, and yet...
it’s normal isn’t it?
Yes, I suppose that would be best.
I guess we must be going then.
Just... one more thing though...
Please... Please just let me have one more cookie.
The recipe is from my own grandmother.
She taught my mother, and my mother taught me.
Did they taste good?
Thank you.
...
That’s all I wanted to hear.
Ha ha ha, that’s good.
You know how to keep an old woman smiling.
Well... I suppose it’s time.
Let’s go.
And...
Thank you.
...
For listening.
